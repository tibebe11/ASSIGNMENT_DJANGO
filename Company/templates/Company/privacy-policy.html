                      There is now an <b class="text-danger">abundance</b> of
                      readable dummy texts. These are usually used when a text
                      is required purely to fill a space. These alternatives to
                      the classic Lorem Ipsum texts are often amusing and tell
                      short, funny or nonsensical stories.

                      It seems that only fragments of the original text remain
                      in the Lorem Ipsum texts used today. One may speculate
                      that over the course of time certain letters were added or
                      deleted at various positions within the text.
